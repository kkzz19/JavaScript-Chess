#About
This is a JavaScript program that plays Chess. Right now you can play against a rudimentary AI.
To play, you start off as white. To make a move, click on a piece, then click on where you want to move it.

This project is meant to be simple. It uses no libraries or dependencies and only has one js file. It uses the canvas and JavaScript prototypical inheritance.
